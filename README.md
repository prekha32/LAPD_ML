# LAPD Crime Data Analysis and Prediction Project using ML

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) using machine learning (ML). The objective is to uncover patterns, identify trends, and predict potential crime hotspots to provide actionable insights for improving public safety.

---

## Problem Statement

The LAPD crime dataset contains valuable information that can help:
- Identify spatial and temporal trends in crime data.
- Classify crime types based on location and time.
- Predict potential crime-prone areas to assist in resource allocation and prevention.

## Dataset

- **Source**: LAPD Crime data
- **Records**: Contains over 100,000 records with attributes like crime type, time, location, and more.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Date and time of crime
  - Type of crime
  - Location coordinates (latitude and longitude)
  - Neighborhood and division information

---

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for classification and prediction.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation.
  - Matplotlib: Visualization of crime trends.
- **Web Technologies**:
  - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: User interface and presentation.
  - JavaScript Plotly: Interactive visualizations.
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL (hosted on Google Cloud SQL): Storing and querying crime data.

## Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Clean and preprocess the LAPD dataset.
   - Explore trends in crime occurrence over time and across neighborhoods.
2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Build and train an ML model to classify and predict crime types.
   - Use clustering techniques to group crime-prone areas.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create interactive visualizations of crime trends using Plotly and Matplotlib.
   - Map crime hotspots using Leaflet.
4. **Application Development**:
   - Develop a user-friendly interface to present insights.

## Team Workflow

1. **Communication**:
   - Primary tool: Slack for group communication and coordination.
   - Scheduled check-ins to track progress and address challenges.

2. **Agile Development**:
   - Use GitHub Projects to manage tasks and milestones.
   - Internal milestones include:
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing
     - Feature engineering
     - Model building and evaluation
     - Visualization and front-end integration




3. **Timeline**:
   - Week 1: Data preparation, exploratory analysis, and ML model selection.
   - Week 2: Model refinement, visualization creation, and final integration.
