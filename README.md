# LAPD Crime Data Analysis and Prediction Project using ML

## Overview

The "Violent Crime Detection" project utilizes data-driven analysis to enhance public safety by pinpointing areas prone to criminal activity. Our goal is to support effective security measures and strengthen community protection.
Machine Learning, with its advanced predictive capabilities, provides a powerful framework for addressing the complexities of crime hotspot identification and prevention.
This presentation highlights Machine Learning, which focuses on leveraging predictive modeling and data insights to analyze and forecast crime trends in Los Angeles.

## Problem Statement

The LAPD crime dataset contains valuable information that can help:
- Develop a machine learning model to predict violent crime trends in Los Angeles using LAPD data from 2020â€“2024.
- Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, guiding feature selection and model 
  design.
- Build and evaluate models with balanced datasets, achieving 65% accuracy, and highlighted precision and recall metrics for crime prediction..
- Utilize Microsoft Azure's PostgreSQL server for scalable, secure, and efficient data management.
. Visualized key findings and predictions to provide actionable insights for improving public safety.
